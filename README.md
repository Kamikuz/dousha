Oh Hi! I don't even know this is a thing now.

Well. Most of my work is not hosted on GitHub. 
They are on a private server. 
So the stat here might be a little bit off.

[![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=dousha&layout=compact)](https://github.com/dousha)

Don't get fooled by the card. I'm actually more 
of a JavaScript person. But languages are just tools, 
right?

Happy hacking, then.
